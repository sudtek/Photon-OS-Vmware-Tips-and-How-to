I have an esxi in my infra and wold like to have VMs with docker to make tests and Pocs but i am behind a proxy.
Configuring VM in order to be able to pass proxy need to be more documented on official photon doc, so this file is only here in order to compil my own investigation howto configure my special case, hope this could be usefull for other !
Thanks 

Proxy : (eolebase 2.6.1)
